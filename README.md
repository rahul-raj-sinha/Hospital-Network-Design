# Hospital-Network-Design

A hospital network design is created using tools like cisco packet tracer. Hospital will have a main block and three wards in the campus. The main block will have 3 floor and the registration of all the new patients will be done here. At the ground floor, there are 10 computers at the billing section. At other floors, there is one computer user each. The farthest distance between the computer on the top most floor and the ground floor is less than 70 meters. The wards have 3 floors each, with 5 computers in the ground floor of each ward.
